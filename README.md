# Word Count (Top 10)

This repo contains implementations of the same program but in different programming styles, including *imperative*, *object-oriented programming*, and *functional programming*. It is intended to be a teaching tool for people starting to learn about functional programming - to get concrete examples of how fp compares to other existing styles.

The way to read this repo is to read each `.js` in order - the files are numbered. The code itself has ample comments.
